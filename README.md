# UNT-Events-App

# Authors: Doreen Lobe, Krushi Patel, Richard Brooks, Samuel Angulo

# This app is designed for students and staff who are interested in the events happening at UNT. We believe that many UNT events don’t receive the recognition they deserve because people often don’t visit the university’s event website. Our idea was to create an easy-to-use app that displays all ongoing and upcoming events at UNT. The app includes features such as liking events and searching for ones that match your interests.
